My name is Tamara Holt and I'm a graduate student in the GIST-MS on-line program at U of A. I'm an Arizona native and have lived in Tucson, AZ for five years. My hobbies and interests are photography, hiking, backpacking, and cycling. This will be my fourth year riding in *El Tour de Tucson* with the team *Pedal with Purpose* fundraising for [**Water for People**](https://fundraise.waterforpeople.org/site/TR/RippleEffect/General/1582572753?pg=team&fr_id=1060&team_id=1030).
